# A VPN SSID over the lxd daemon on OpenWrt

> 🌐 Русская версия: **[openwrt-vpn-ssid.ru.md](openwrt-vpn-ssid.ru.md)**.

How to build a separate Wi-Fi whose whole traffic goes through the sing-box core
without touching the main home network. This extends
[lxd-daemon.md](lxd-daemon.md): the daemon guide installs and configures
`sing-box lxd` itself; here is the network plumbing around it (Wi-Fi → bridge →
tun → firewall).

> ⚡ Prefer not to build by hand? The whole segment — daemon included — installs
> with one script: **[scripts-lx/openwrt](../scripts-lx/openwrt/README.md)**
> (binary download with an sha256 check, bridge, DHCP, fail-closed firewall,
> procd service, pairing invite; plus a teardown/rollback script and operations
> recipes). This page stays the reference for how it all works inside.

> This is an applied recipe for OpenWrt/fw4, **not** a fork feature. Every

> Proven on OpenWrt 24.10 (fw4/nftables, mt76). The daemon must already be
> installed per §8.3 of the daemon guide.

## 0. Preconditions (check before §2)

Before building the segment, make sure the base is ready — otherwise the build
falls apart at the first step.

**The daemon is already installed and running.** Installation, the procd service
and uploading the binary are in daemon guide [§8.3](lxd-daemon.md). Here a live
`sing-box lxd` on the router is assumed.

**The base network is alive: WAN is up, there is internet.** Without it neither
`opkg update`, nor uploading the core, nor `apply` with an external config will
go through.

```bash
ping -c1 8.8.8.8 && nslookup openwrt.org        # router's WAN and DNS work
```

**There is enough room.** The binary is ~50 MB — it does not fit a router without
extroot; you need extroot/USB (details and why — daemon guide §8.3). Check free
space where the binary and state go:

```bash
df -h /overlay /                                # or the extroot mount point
```

**Wi-Fi radios exist and you know their names.** The guide uses `radio0`/`radio1`
(typical for a dual-band mt76), but your router's names and radio count may
differ — verify and substitute your own in §6:

```bash
uci show wireless | grep '=wifi-device'         # radio0, radio1, …
iw dev                                          # physical interfaces and their phy
```

**Tools are present.** busybox has no `nohup`; the checks below need `ip`, `uci`,
`fw4`, `nft` (standard on OpenWrt 24.10). `nslookup` comes with the
`dnsmasq`/`libustream` package.

**Take a config backup — now, before the first step** (not at the end: rolling
back only makes sense to the state *before* the edits). OpenWrt often has no
sftp-server, so `scp` fails — stream the file over ssh:

```bash
ssh root@HOST 'sysupgrade -b /tmp/bk.tar.gz && cat /tmp/bk.tar.gz' > bk-before-vpn.tar.gz
```

To restore if needed — `sysupgrade -r bk-before-vpn.tar.gz` (upload the file back
by the same stream first).

## 1. Principles (why it is shaped this way)

Goal: a separate Wi-Fi through the core, while **the main network depends on the
core in no way whatsoever** — losing LAN/SSH is unacceptable (the router is
managed remotely). Two decisions follow and shape everything:

1. **Isolation by interface, not by address.** The core intercepts traffic only
   from the VPN-segment bridge; `br-lan` is outside its remit entirely. The
   mechanism is `include_interface` on the tun inbound (see §5).
2. **Fail-closed, not fail-open.** Core dies → the VPN segment loses internet. A
   silent leak from the home IP is worse than a visible outage. The mechanism is
   the absence of a `lxdvpn→wan` forwarding (see §4).

```
                        ┌─ br-lan (192.168.10.0/24) ─→ zone lan ──────────┐
Wi-Fi (2 radios) ───────┤                                                  ├─→ WAN → internet
                        └─ br-lxdvpn (192.168.20.0/24) ─→ zone lxdvpn ─────┘
                                        │ forwarding: ONLY lxdvpn→sbtun
                                        ▼
                              iif br-lxdvpn → lxd-tun0 (zone sbtun)
                                        │
                              sing-box lxd (procd, control channel)
                                        │
                                  outbound → upstream
```

The upper branch (home network) does not change. The lower one is everything
added.

Below is the build from scratch, step by step, with a check after each. Order
matters: bring up Wi-Fi **last**, once the bridge, addressing and firewall are
ready — otherwise the APs attach to nothing.

> **If you work over SSH remotely — read the warnings in steps 3 and 5 first.**
> Restarting dnsmasq drops the whole LAN's DNS for a second, and `wifi reload`
> tears down both radios for ~10 seconds (your Wi-Fi session with them). Over the
> wire or from a separate management interface is safer.

## 2. Bridge

```bash
uci set network.brlxdvpn=device
uci set network.brlxdvpn.name='br-lxdvpn'
uci set network.brlxdvpn.type='bridge'
uci set network.brlxdvpn.bridge_empty='1'
uci commit network
reload_config
```

`bridge_empty='1'` is **mandatory**. Without it netifd refuses to bring up a
portless bridge and the interface never appears (`Device "br-lxdvpn" does not
exist`). The Wi-Fi APs attach later and dynamically, when hostapd starts — at
creation time it is empty.

Check:

```bash
ip link show br-lxdvpn        # the interface exists (even without carrier)
```

## 3. The segment's gateway interface

```bash
uci set network.lxdvpn=interface
uci set network.lxdvpn.device='br-lxdvpn'
uci set network.lxdvpn.proto='static'
uci set network.lxdvpn.ipaddr='192.168.20.1'
uci set network.lxdvpn.netmask='255.255.255.0'
uci commit network
reload_config
```

`ip6assign` is deliberately **left unset** — IPv6 is not wanted in the segment,
or a client would get an address via RA and leak around the tunnel (sing-box
`auto_route` catches IPv4 in this configuration). The subnet must not overlap LAN
nor any upstream subnets (e.g. WG instances).

Check:

```bash
ip addr show br-lxdvpn        # expect inet 192.168.20.1/24
```

The `NO-CARRIER … DOWN` state is normal — nobody is in the bridge yet.

## 4. DHCP for the segment

```bash
uci set dhcp.lxdvpn=dhcp
uci set dhcp.lxdvpn.interface='lxdvpn'
uci set dhcp.lxdvpn.start='100'
uci set dhcp.lxdvpn.limit='150'
uci set dhcp.lxdvpn.leasetime='12h'
uci set dhcp.lxdvpn.dhcpv4='server'
uci add_list dhcp.lxdvpn.dhcp_option='6,8.8.8.8'
uci commit dhcp
/etc/init.d/dnsmasq restart
```

- **Option 6 (DNS) must not point at the router's dnsmasq.** Otherwise resolution
  goes around the tunnel and leaks domains to the ISP. With a direct outbound it
  is literally external DNS; with an upstream, DNS is hijacked inside the tunnel
  (hijack-dns) and the address becomes a nominal marker. Leave `ra`/`dhcpv6`
  unset.

> ⚠️ **Restarting dnsmasq drops the whole LAN's DNS for a second.** Account for
> it when working remotely.

Check — the main LAN's DNS is alive:

```bash
nslookup openwrt.org 192.168.1.1         # your LAN gateway address (OpenWrt default)
```

## 5. Firewall (fail-closed)

```bash
uci set firewall.lxdvpn=zone
uci set firewall.lxdvpn.name='lxdvpn'
uci add_list firewall.lxdvpn.network='lxdvpn'
uci set firewall.lxdvpn.input='ACCEPT'
uci set firewall.lxdvpn.output='ACCEPT'
uci set firewall.lxdvpn.forward='REJECT'
uci commit firewall
fw4 reload
```

The key fact: **do not create a `lxdvpn→wan` forwarding at all.** The only
allowed path outward is into the tunnel zone `sbtun` (that zone and the
`sbtun_tcp` rule are created in §8, once the tun interface is up). No tunnel → no
path → traffic is dropped at the nftables level. This is not a "just-in-case"
setting but a structural property: for the segment to leak into WAN you must
**deliberately** add a rule.

- `input=ACCEPT` on the `lxdvpn` zone lets clients reach DHCP and the gateway.
- Do **not** create forwarding between `lxdvpn` and `lan` — a segment client does
  not see home devices.

## 6. Wi-Fi into the bridge

```bash
uci set wireless.lxdvpn_2g=wifi-iface
uci set wireless.lxdvpn_2g.device='radio0'
uci set wireless.lxdvpn_2g.mode='ap'
uci set wireless.lxdvpn_2g.network='lxdvpn'
uci set wireless.lxdvpn_2g.ssid='LxdVPN2G'
uci set wireless.lxdvpn_2g.encryption='psk2'
uci set wireless.lxdvpn_2g.key='your-password'
uci commit wireless
```

(likewise `lxdvpn_5g` on `radio1` with `ssid='LxdVPN5G'`)

The `network='lxdvpn'` line ties it to the bridge — the AP lands in `br-lxdvpn`
automatically. mt76 holds several APs per radio, so existing networks are
untouched.

Apply it **detached from the terminal**, because `wifi reload` tears down both
radios for ~10 seconds and will kill your SSH session if you are on Wi-Fi:

```bash
wifi reload >/tmp/wifi.log 2>&1 </dev/null &
```

> busybox has no `nohup` — do not use it.

Check after reconnecting — **the APs actually landed in the bridge**:

```bash
ls /sys/class/net/br-lxdvpn/brif/        # expect phy0-ap1, phy1-ap1
```

Empty = a typo in `network='lxdvpn'`: the AP came up but in the wrong bridge. The
symptom is deceptive — the client associates to Wi-Fi but gets no address, and
the cause is not DHCP.

## 7. Core config (applied via the daemon)

```json
{
  "log": { "level": "info" },
  "inbounds": [
    {
      "type": "tun",
      "tag": "tun-in",
      "interface_name": "lxd-tun0",
      "address": ["172.19.0.1/30"],
      "mtu": 1400,
      "auto_route": true,
      "strict_route": false,
      "include_interface": ["br-lxdvpn"],
      "stack": "system"
    }
  ],
  "outbounds": [ { "type": "direct", "tag": "direct-out" } ],
  "route": { "final": "direct-out", "auto_detect_interface": true }
}
```

The fields that matter:

| Field | Why exactly this |
|---|---|
| `include_interface: ["br-lxdvpn"]` | **The main isolation guarantee.** `auto_route` is greedy on its own — it would pull the whole host into the tunnel. This filter narrows it to a single bridge; `br-lan` and router traffic are untouched. This holds the **VPN-segment bridge name**, nothing else |
| `auto_route: true` | the core writes policy routing itself instead of manual `ip rule` |
| `strict_route: false` | strict mode adds extra blocking rules — one more source of conflicts on a router with fw4 |
| `stack: "system"` | system stack instead of gvisor — faster on a weak CPU; the price is the TCP nuance in §8.1 |
| `mtu: 1400` | headroom for future upstream overhead (WG/VLESS), so the outbound swap needs no rework |
| `address: 172.19.0.1/30` | the tunnel's service p2p subnet |

`direct-out` is a stub (traffic exits to WAN as-is). A real upstream (WG, VLESS,
…) is set by replacing `outbounds`/`route` in **one apply**; the scaffold,
firewall and Wi-Fi are not touched.

Deliver the config over the daemon's channel, not by editing a file on disk:

```bash
curl -sk -X POST https://DAEMON:PORT/admin/apply --cert … --key … -d @config.json
```

(authentication as in daemon guide §5/§9; locally on the router use loopback).
After apply the `lxd-tun0` interface comes up — now the firewall can be closed
onto the tunnel (§8).

**Isolation check — this settles the main fear, "did it pull the whole router
into the tunnel".** `auto_route` with `include_interface` writes policy routing,
visible in `ip rule`:

```bash
ip rule | head -3
# 9000: from all iif br-lxdvpn goto 9002   ← only traffic from the segment bridge → tunnel
# 9001: from all goto 9010                 ← everything else goes past, into main
```

The decision is made by **incoming interface** (`iif br-lxdvpn`), not by source
address — `br-lan` and the router's own traffic never touch the tunnel. If there
is no `iif br-lxdvpn` rule, or it is `from all` without `iif`,
`include_interface` did not take — check the bridge name in the core config.

## 8. Tunnel firewall — closing fail-closed

Done **after** the core config: the zone binds to an already-existing tun device.
Three parts: the tunnel zone, the single allowed forwarding from the segment into
it, and a targeted TCP ACCEPT (explained below).

```bash
# the tunnel zone
uci set firewall.sbtun=zone
uci set firewall.sbtun.name='sbtun'
uci add_list firewall.sbtun.device='lxd-tun0'
uci set firewall.sbtun.input='REJECT'
uci set firewall.sbtun.output='ACCEPT'
uci set firewall.sbtun.forward='REJECT'
# the only path outward: segment → tunnel
uci set firewall.lxdvpn2tun=forwarding
uci set firewall.lxdvpn2tun.src='lxdvpn'
uci set firewall.lxdvpn2tun.dest='sbtun'
# ACCEPT for system-stack TCP (see below)
uci set firewall.sbtun_tcp=rule
uci set firewall.sbtun_tcp.name='Allow-sbtun-systemstack-tcp'
uci set firewall.sbtun_tcp.src='sbtun'
uci set firewall.sbtun_tcp.dest_ip='172.19.0.1'
uci set firewall.sbtun_tcp.proto='tcp'
uci set firewall.sbtun_tcp.target='ACCEPT'
uci commit firewall
fw4 reload
```

`firewall.sbtun.device='lxd-tun0'` **binds the zone to the device by name.** If
the tun name changes in the core config, the zone goes empty and the whole
segment loses internet (the only forwarding leads into `sbtun`). See §9.

Check:

```bash
nft list ruleset | grep -A2 Allow-sbtun-systemstack-tcp
```

### 8.1. Why `sbtun_tcp`: `stack: "system"` + fw4 silently drops TCP

Symptom: UDP and ICMP traverse the tunnel, DNS resolves, but **TCP does not
establish at all**; the core log shows only `inbound packet connection`, not a
single TCP connect.

Cause: under `stack: "system"` sing-box does not handle TCP straight from the
tun fd — it redirects it to a local listener on the tunnel address
(`172.19.0.1:<dynamic port>`). To the Linux kernel this is an ordinary inbound to
a local address — it goes through **INPUT** in zone `sbtun`, where `input=REJECT`,
and dies there. UDP/ICMP do not take this path (sing-box reads them straight from
the tun fd), which is why it looked selective. `sbtun_tcp` is a targeted ACCEPT
to the tunnel address over TCP; fail-closed is not diluted.

> ⚠️ The rule is bound to the **IP**. Changing the tun inbound's `address`
> (including by a foreign apply) breaks it: clients get `connection refused` on
> any TCP while ICMP/DNS stay alive. Keep `dest_ip` in sync with the config's
> `address` (see §9).

## 9. Name/address consistency — the main landmine

Two core-config fields hold the firewall plumbing, and desyncing either breaks
the segment — while the core looks perfectly healthy:

| What | Where | Tied to |
|---|---|---|
| `interface_name` | core config | ← → `firewall.sbtun.device` (§8) |
| `address` | core config | ← → `firewall.sbtun_tcp.dest_ip` (§8) |

**Any third-party apply (e.g. pushed from the launcher) can change
`interface_name` or `address`** — and firewall rules bound to the old name/IP
silently stop matching. The daemon is not at fault: it faithfully applied the
config it was sent. Check after every non-trivial apply:

```bash
ip addr show lxd-tun0 | grep inet          # the tunnel's current address
nft list ruleset | grep Allow-sbtun-systemstack-tcp   # packets 0 under live traffic = desync
```

## 10. Verification

| Check | Expectation |
|---|---|
| DHCP | client gets an address from `192.168.20.0/24`, gw `.1`, DNS from option 6 |
| ICMP | `ping 8.8.8.8` from the segment works |
| DNS | resolution through the tunnel works |
| TCP/HTTP | external IP = the upstream's address (with `direct`, the router's WAN address) |
| Transit | `tx_bytes` on `lxd-tun0` grows in step with traffic |
| **Fail-closed** | stop the daemon service → tunnel gone, ping 100% loss, TCP dropped, **no WAN leak** |
| Recovery | start the service → daemon brings up last-good, client back online |

Check the main channel (LAN/SSH/your Mac's internet) after every layer — it must
always stay alive: that is the whole point of the isolation.

### 10.1. A virtual client — how to test without a phone

During remote setup there is **nobody** to associate a real device with the new
SSID, and without a client you cannot prove fail-closed. Build one right on the
router: a `veth` pair, one leg in the segment bridge, the other in an isolated
network namespace (mimicking a separate device behind Wi-Fi).

```bash
opkg update && opkg install kmod-veth
ip link add v0 type veth peer name v1
ip netns add t && ip link set v1 netns t
ip link set v0 master br-lxdvpn && ip link set v0 up
ip netns exec t ip link set v1 up
# the netns inherits the router's resolv.conf (127.0.0.1) — absent inside it; give it its own:
mkdir -p /etc/netns/t && echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" > /etc/netns/t/resolv.conf

# get a DHCP lease and check the exit
ip netns exec t udhcpc -i v1 -n -q -s /usr/share/udhcpc/default.script
ip netns exec t ping -c1 8.8.8.8                 # ICMP through the tunnel
ip netns exec t wget -qO- http://api.ipify.org   # external IP = the upstream's?
```

The **fail-closed** check (the crucial one): stop the daemon service and repeat —

```bash
/etc/init.d/sing-box-lxd stop
ip netns exec t ping -c2 8.8.8.8                  # expect 100% loss
ip netns exec t wget -qO- --timeout=5 http://api.ipify.org  # expect failure, NOT a WAN IP
/etc/init.d/sing-box-lxd start                    # restore
```

If an external IP still comes back with the daemon stopped — **a WAN leak**,
there is a stray forwarding somewhere (see §5): the segment must stay offline.

Clean up:

```bash
ip netns del t && ip link del v0 && rm -rf /etc/netns/t
```

> Two gotchas: **`kmod-veth` is not in the base firmware** — without it `ip link
> add … type veth` gives `Unknown device type` (`opkg install kmod-veth`, which
> needs a live WAN — see §0). And **the netns does not inherit a working
> resolv.conf**: the router's `127.0.0.1` does not exist inside it, so its own
> `/etc/netns/t/resolv.conf` is mandatory or DNS in the namespace is dead.

## 11. Persistence (OpenWrt)

`sysupgrade` keeps neither the binary, the state, nor the daemon's init script —
see §8.3 of the daemon guide. The UCI sections
(`wireless`/`network`/`dhcp`/`firewall`) survive `sysupgrade -b` but **not**
`sysupgrade -n` (reset to defaults). The config backup is taken **before** the
build begins — see §0.
