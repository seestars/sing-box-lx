# sing-box-lx — energy optimization on mobile (idle-suspend × urltest)

This is the main document on **why the fork saves battery on Android and how to control it**. Upstream sing-box keeps every WireGuard/AmneziaWG endpoint alive 24/7 regardless of traffic: recv-workers with their buffers (~8 MB per worker at the mobile `BatchSize=128` — the dominant GC-heat source; measured on-device: 8 endpoints suspended freed 134 MB), plus keepalive/handshake timers that wake the radio. The fork adds selective **suspension** of idle endpoints and teaches the health-check machinery **not to keep them awake**. The full model, step by step, follows.

```

Separate from all this lives the **urltest health check** (probes). It is not part of the suspend machinery, but every probe is an ordinary dial and therefore **wakes** sleeping endpoints. Half of the optimizations are about making probes run only when genuinely needed (§6).

## 2. The reachability layer

An endpoint is **reachable** if a new connection can land on it right now. Walk seeds (entry points):

- `route.final` (the default outbound);
- the target of every route/bypass rule;
- **every DNS server's detour** — DNS is dialed on every resolution, so a DNS-only node is reachable by definition (otherwise it would flap Down/Up around every quiet gap, adding a handshake to the first DNS query of each session).

Descent: a selector → its current choice only (`Now()`); a round_robin urltest → its **whole current pool**; a legacy urltest → the currently selected node; an ordinary outbound → its detour chain. Everything is transitive; cycles are cut.

The set is cached and recomputed **only on events** (selector switch, urltest auto-switch — including the very first selection, pool rebuild, config reload). Between events the tick reads the ready map — one map lookup plus a couple of atomics per endpoint per tick.

## 3. Two idle thresholds

```jsonc
"lx": {
  "wg": {
    "idle_suspend": "30s",             // threshold for UNREACHABLE endpoints (feature switch)
    "idle_suspend_reachable": "5m",    // optional: threshold for REACHABLE endpoints
    "idle_teardown": "5m"              // optional: how long to SLEEP before full teardown;
                                       //   defaults to idle_suspend_reachable, "0" = off
  }
}
```

The keys live in the root `lx` block since SPEC 098 ([lx-config.md §13](lx-config.md#13-the-lx-root-block-spec-098)).
The old `route.lx_idle_suspend` / `route.lx_idle_suspend_reachable` / `route.lx_idle_teardown`
are accepted for one release as deprecated aliases, with a warning per key; a value that differs
between the two places is a start error.

| | Unreachable endpoint | Reachable endpoint | Any SLEEPING endpoint |
|---|---|---|---|
| Threshold | `lx.wg.idle_suspend` (30s idle) | `lx.wg.idle_suspend_reachable` (5m idle); `0`/absent — never | `lx.wg.idle_teardown` (5m of **sleep**, counted from falling asleep); an explicit `0` never tears down, an absent key inherits the reachable window |
| What happens | `Down()` — freeze | `Down()` — freeze | **`Close()`** — full teardown: the gVisor netstack (~6 MB/node) goes too |
| Wake | dial, +1 RTT | dial, +1 RTT | dial, **rebuild ~0.5–1 s** on the first request |

The third level is "deep sleep": a freeze (`Down`) releases recv-buffers and timers but the netstack survives; a node that has slept through one more window is torn down entirely — nothing but its config remains. The window counts **from the moment of falling asleep** (not from the last dial), so it does not depend on which threshold put the node to sleep. Live connections are untouched by construction: a node with flows simply never falls asleep (§4), and only sleepers are torn down.

Validation: the reachable threshold requires `lx.wg.idle_suspend` and must be `>=` it. Recommendation: `>=` the `idle_timeout` of your urltest groups (explained in §7).

"Idle" = time since the last **dial** through the endpoint (new-connection creation). Data on already-established connections bypasses the dial path — gates §4.5–4.6 protect it.

## 4. The tick decision: gate chain

Every tick, for every endpoint, cheapest-first:

1. **Listen mode** (`listen_port` set) → never suspend: inbound peers have no way to wake it.
2. **Window selection**: unreachable → `lx.wg.idle_suspend`; reachable → `lx.wg.idle_suspend_reachable` (or bail out if unset).
3. **Idle clock**: `IdleSince() < window` → too early.
4. **Already down** (guard/closed) → someone else's state, don't touch.
5. **Live TCP flows**: the device gVisor stack's `CurrentEstablished` gauge > 0 → established connections exist (a download, a push socket) → don't suspend. Precise and **keepalive-immune** (a keepalive is not a TCP flow).
6. **Counter delta**: rx+tx grew by **≥ 4096 bytes** since the previous decision → live UDP/QUIC traffic → refresh the clock, don't suspend. A threshold rather than a bare "changed" check on purpose: WG keepalive (32 B/interval) and rekeys (~240 B/~2 min) move the counters forever — a `persistent_keepalive` peer must still be able to sleep (silencing its timers is half the win). A fully silent QUIC flow (rare pings below the threshold) will be suspended — an accepted trade-off; QUIC migrates/re-establishes.
7. All quiet → `device.Down()`, log `lx idle: suspend <tag>`.

## 5. Down, Close, and the wake cost

`Down()` (levels 1–2) is a freeze, not a Close: the UDP socket closes (recv-workers exit and release their buffers — the main RAM/GC win), session keys are zeroed, and **all** peer timers stop (keepalive, retransmit, the whole AWG junk machinery). Objects and the port survive the cycle.

`Close()` (level 3, `lx.wg.idle_teardown`) is a teardown: the netstack, the Device/Peer objects, the queues and every device goroutine are gone; only the config remains in memory. Waking rebuilds from scratch (**~0.5–1 s** on the first dial instead of +1 RTT).

**What each level actually buys** (measured on-device, CPH2411 — not an estimate):

| Level | Frees | Measured |
|---|---|---|
| 1–2 (`Down`) | recv-workers + their buffers (~8 MB/worker, 2 per device), timers | **−134 MB** with 8 endpoints suspended (`bufsArrs` 223.93→89.89 MB) |
| 3 (`Close`) | netstack + Device objects + every device goroutine | ~5.9 MB/node; with 3 nodes the heap barely moved (36.7→36.3 MB) |

The modest level-3 delta is not the feature's fault: **63% of the heap (23.4 MB) is held by the global `sing/common/buf` pool** (`GetOutboundBuffer → buf.Get`) — process-wide, surviving both `Down` and `Close` **by design**, and never returning memory to the OS. Against a pool that size, three netstacks are noise.

Tuning takeaway: **level 1 delivers the bulk of the RAM win**; level 3 pays off with **many** nodes (dozens), not three — there it reclaims another ~6 MB per sleeper. Do not expect miracles from it on a small config; its second value is fewer live objects under the `SetMemoryLimit` ceiling, i.e. less GC pressure for the nodes actually in use.

Waking has **exactly one path**: a real dial through the endpoint (`DialContext`/`ListenPacket`/L3 forwarding). It re-opens the socket and workers; the first packet waits for a fresh handshake — **+1 RTT** (14–21 ms on a nearby server, up to ~450 ms intercontinental). Throughput is unaffected.

> **Why the +1 RTT is here to stay.** The theoretical alternative — waking with the crypto session intact (`BindUpdate` leaves the keys alone) — is **rejected**: a WireGuard session lives 120 s and is invalid past 180 s while we sleep for minutes, so the handshake happens anyway; and on mobile a network change (Wi-Fi↔LTE) during sleep makes the endpoint the server knows stale, turning the "saving" into a timeout instead of a normal handshake on CGNAT paths. Full reasoning: SPEC 020 §"ОТВЕРГНУТО: путь A".

Wake nuances (frequently asked):
- **The attempt itself wakes, not its success.** The wake happens at dial entry, before anything is sent; if the connection then fails (target unreachable), the tunnel is already awake and will fall asleep again after its window. "Any app" = any app whose traffic is routed into this tunnel; apps going direct/through another channel don't wake it.
- **An open TCP socket keeps the tunnel awake entirely** (the established-flows gate, §4.5) — so the "app writes into a socket while the tunnel already sleeps" case does not exist for TCP. A silent UDP/QUIC session may fall asleep; QUIC then re-establishes with a fresh dial — which is exactly what wakes the tunnel.

What does **not** wake an endpoint:
- screen-on / network change (pause-wake): the transport remembers a `suspended` flag and skips such devices — otherwise one screen cycle would resurrect everything and desync the bookkeeping until restart;
- a guard-suspended AWG endpoint (see SPEC 007) is resurrected by nothing short of a core restart — that is the AWG-over-WG kernel-hang protection.

For domain destinations, DNS resolution happens **before** the wake — a failed lookup does not pay a handshake. **This is safe — a sleeping tunnel cannot "take DNS down"**: resolution never depends on the sleeping tunnel blindly. Ordinary DNS doesn't touch it at all (a failed lookup would mean DNS is broken regardless of the tunnel's state), and a DNS server detoured *through* this very tunnel sends its query as a separate dial to the server's IP — and that dial **wakes the tunnel itself**. The "asleep, therefore can't resolve" deadlock is impossible by construction.

## 6. urltest: probes, and how they were taught to stay quiet

A health-check probe is an ordinary dial through the node — i.e. it **wakes** a sleeper. The mechanisms bounding probes:

| Mechanism | Level | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `idle_timeout` (upstream, 30m) | group | no traffic through the group for longer → the probe ticker **stops for good**; the next dial (`Touch`) restarts it and runs an immediate re-test |
| Reachability gate (lx) | group | group unreachable (selector left) → cycles are **skipped** immediately, without waiting for idle_timeout; the ticker stays alive and self-recovers |
| `passive_check` (lx, opt-in) | node/cycle | a successful TCP dial through a node proves liveness (the SYN/SYN-ACK traversed the whole chain); while fresh (< interval): least_test skips whole cycles, round_robin skips confirmed slots |
| round_robin pool (lx) | mode | only pool members are probed (e.g. 3), not all N nodes; out-of-pool nodes only when refilling holes |
| Manual test | — | always full (force), never gated |

An important consequence for an active least_test group: **without** `passive_check` it probes every member each `interval`, waking sleepers (upstream semantics — picking the best requires measuring everyone). With `passive_check`, probes simply don't run while traffic itself proves the selection healthy.

## 7. Timelines

### Night (round_robin pool=3, interval=15m, idle_timeout=30m, thresholds 30s/30m)

```
T=0        last user dial
T=0..30m   probe tail: the ticker is still alive, probes at T=15m and T=30m
           dial the pool (nodes don't sleep — every probe resets their clocks)
T≈45m      Since(lastActive) > idle_timeout → probe ticker STOPS
T≈60m      pool members' idle (since the last probe at T=30m) > 30m →
           the tick suspends all 3 nodes — complete silence until morning
MORNING    the first dial wakes ONE node (+1 RTT); Touch restarts the ticker;
           an immediate re-test refreshes the pool within seconds
```

The "probe wakes a falling-asleep node" race cannot happen by construction: probes go silent at `T = idle_timeout`, reachable-sleep starts no earlier than `T = last probe + reachable`. With `reachable >= idle_timeout` the alarm clock is already dead by bedtime. (Violating the recommendation is not breakage: 1–2 flap cycles in the tail.)

### Selector switching away from a group

```
T=0   the selector moves off group AUTO
      → InvalidateReachability: AUTO and its members become unreachable
T=0+  AUTO's scheduled probe cycles are SKIPPED (reachability gate)
~30s+ AUTO's members fall asleep on the SHORT threshold (they are unreachable)
T=30m idle_timeout retires AUTO's ticker for good
```

Before this revision an abandoned group kept probing (and waking) all members for another 30 minutes — up to 10 cycles × N handshakes for nothing.

## 8. Recommended mobile configuration

```jsonc
{
  "lx": {
    "wg": {
      "idle_suspend": "30s",
      "idle_suspend_reachable": "30m"
    }
  },
  "outbounds": [{
    "type": "urltest",
    "tag": "auto",
    "outbounds": ["node-1", "…", "node-N"],
    "interval": "15m",          // rarer cycles where they still run
    "idle_timeout": "30m",      // = the reachable threshold (see §7)
    "passive_check": true,      // traffic itself confirms liveness — probes stay quiet
    "mode": "round_robin",      // the pool is probed, not all N
    "balancer": { "pool": 3, "pool_tolerance": 0 }
  }]
}
```

Threshold coordination rules:

| Constraint | Enforced by | Consequence of violation |
|---|---|---|
| `interval <= idle_timeout` | core (upstream), start error | — |
| `lx.wg.idle_suspend_reachable >= lx.wg.idle_suspend` | core (lx), start error | — |
| `lx.wg.idle_suspend_reachable >= idle_timeout` of groups | recommendation | 1–2 probe flaps in the falling-asleep tail |
| a low reachable value (e.g. `5m`) | allowed | fast sleep during pauses; the cost is the same 1–2 extra handshakes during the first ~half hour of silence (until probes retire) plus +1 RTT on the first connection after every ≥5m pause |
| `interval` > MASQUE idle (5m) for groups with MASQUE nodes | recommendation | probes keep the MASQUE tunnel from sleeping |
| `pool_tolerance <= 15000` | core (lx), start error | — |

Notes:
- `pool_tolerance > 0` is discouraged on mobile: that mode must measure **all** candidates every cycle (waking every sleeper outside the pool).
- `persistent_keepalive` on peers is compatible with suspend: the timer is stopped while asleep, and keepalive noise does not block falling asleep (§4.6). An awake keepalive node keeps waking the radio — that is the user's choice.
- The whole feature is disabled by omitting `lx.wg.idle_suspend` (kill switch, zero overhead) and exists only in the mobile AAR (`with_lx_idle_suspend`); a desktop binary given this key fails fast at start with an explicit error.

## 9. Guarantees (what will NOT break)

- **Live connections are never cut**: a node carrying an established TCP flow or bulk UDP traffic is not suspended, however "idle" it looks by dials (§4.5–4.6). The `interrupt_exist_connections=false` promise holds.
- **Screen-off/on and network changes don't desync anything**: suspended devices stay suspended through pause/wake cycles.
- **The AWG guard outranks idle logic**: a guard-downed AWG endpoint is woken by nothing — not a dial, not pause, not a probe.
- **The first request after sleep always works**: it goes through the last known node (waking it), while an immediate re-test refreshes the selection in parallel. If that node died overnight — one request fails and the re-test repairs the pool right away.
- **Kill switch**: without `lx.wg.idle_suspend` not even the tick starts.

## 10. Observability and troubleshooting

- `lx idle: suspend <tag> idle=…` / `lx idle: wake <tag> by=dial` — edge-triggered pairs in the log. **Frequent suspend↔wake pairs for one tag = flapping** — check threshold coordination (§8) and that the probe gates are active.
- A sleeping node = 0 recv-workers for its device (goroutine profile) and zero rx/tx.
- A node "won't sleep although it should": is it reachable? (selector/pool/rule/DNS detour — §2); does it carry established TCP? bulk UDP?
- A node "won't wake": see SPEC 007 — is it a guard-downed AWG? (`amneziawg endpoint suspended/will not start` in the log).
- Probes "run at night": is there traffic through the group (`Touch` keeps the ticker alive)? Remember that background push connections count as traffic too.
- `lx idle: teardown <tag> by=budget` — the build budget tore the node down to make room for another (§11); `lx idle: build over budget N+1/N <tag>` — a build went over `build_max` because every built node carried live connections (`build_overflow: "build"`); `lx idle: build <tag>: build budget exhausted (N built, none idle)` — the dial gave up waiting for a slot (`build_overflow: "wait"`).

## 11. Lazy build and the build budget (SPEC 097)

Suspend and teardown free what an endpoint holds once it has been idle. A config with a dozen AWG nodes still pays for all of them at start: each device allocates its receive batches (128 × 64 KB per bind on Android, where the 64 KB segments feed GRO) the moment it starts, ≈17.5 MB per node. Two keys keep devices from being built for nothing.

**`lx.wg.lazy_build: true`** — endpoints start at level 3 (§5): the detour is resolved at start as before, but the device and its netstack are not built. The first dial through the node (a user connection or a urltest probe) builds it along the same path a wake after teardown takes, and pays that cost once: the build plus the first handshake. A listen-mode endpoint (`listen_port`) is never lazy — nothing dials it. Requires `lx.wg.idle_suspend`.

**`lx.wg.build_max: N`** — at most N devices are built at once. Laziness alone only postpones the peak: a urltest probe of the whole group builds every node right after start. With a cap, a dial that needs device N+1 first tears down a victim:

1. devices built over the cap (`build_overflow: "build"`) go first;
2. then the node with the fewest **manual** refs — edges from a selector's current choice, the `final` outbound, a rule target;
3. then the fewest **auto** refs — a urltest pool, another node's `detour`, a DNS server's `detour`, a chain position;
4. then the node dialed longest ago.

The order is lexicographic: any number of auto refs loses to one manual ref. A ref is an edge leading straight into the node; nothing is inherited along the tree (selector → urltest → X gives X one auto ref). Sleep is not a key: an asleep node with a ref outlives an awake node without one. Traffic does not rank, it only guards: a node with a dial in flight, an established TCP flow or ≥ 4096 bytes moved since the budget's previous sample of it is never torn down. A node without refs that was built a moment ago is a legal victim — probes cannot wait out a sleep threshold.

When every built node is guarded, `lx.wg.build_overflow` decides:

| Value | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `wait` (default) | the dial waits for a slot until its own deadline, at most 15 s; a released slot, a node falling asleep or a flow ending (checked every second) lets it retry. Past the deadline the dial fails and the node counts as unreachable **for this probe**, not dead |
| `build` | the device is built over the cap with a warning; the next build tears the over-cap device down first |

Probes under a cap run in waves: a group of K nodes with `build_max: N` is measured N builds at a time, so a probe round takes longer while memory stays bounded. If a wave does not fit into the probe timeout, the tail of the group is reported unavailable for that round.

`build_max` without `lazy_build` is legal: devices are built at start as before, and the cap applies from the first rebuild (a wake after `idle_teardown`). A cap below the number of nodes in simultaneous use makes nodes tear each other down on every switch (each dial pays a build); LxBox sets `build_max` for probe sessions only.

**States.** `GetOutbounds` reports each WG/AWG endpoint's state in `endpointState` (with seconds since its last dial in `idleSinceSeconds`):

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `never_built` | lazy endpoint, no dial yet |
| `building` | a build is in progress (the budget wait included) |
| `up` | device built and awake |
| `asleep` | device built, Down (levels 1–2) |
| `torn_down` | device released (level 3, or evicted by the budget) |
| `down` | not started yet, or closed |

"Not built" is a state, not an error: the app shows "node not brought up" and does not treat it as a timeout.
