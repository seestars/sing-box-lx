// startIdleSuspend is the no-`with_lx_idle_suspend` stub. The idle-suspend tick
// (SPEC 020) is a mobile-only power/RAM feature — it only pays off where the
// recv-worker bufsArrs are large (Android/iOS, BatchSize=128), so it is gated
// behind the build tag and included only in mobile builds.
//
// If any lx.wg.* key is set (the idle windows, an explicit idle_teardown
// including "0", lazy_build, build_max, build_overflow "build") but the binary
// was built without the tag, we fail loudly at start rather than silently
// ignoring it — a silent no-op would hide a misconfigured build. When nothing
// is set the stub is a clean no-op and the endpoint idle machinery
// (stampActivity / resumeOnDial) stays dormant: idleAsleep is never set, so
// resumeOnDial always takes its fast path and the hot dial path is unaffected.
